Ex 1
========

 - The DB used is postgresql.
 - Using the Public schema.
 - Use the reset.sql script to create the table **before** running the application.
 - Running the script **erases the old table**, so beware!
 - I did not spend much time doing error handling, something I would have surely done in a real application.
 - The code comes with an ant build script, just run ant without any arguments and find ex1.jar under bin\deploy.
